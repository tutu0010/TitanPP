# Titan++ 🛠️

**Titan++** is a single, massive C++ learning project designed to teach *everything* from beginner basics to advanced, near-expert topics.  
Instead of small, disconnected exercises, Titan++ is one continuous project that evolves step by step — growing from a simple `Hello World` into a powerful, modular framework touching almost every feature of modern C++.

## 📚 Why Titan++?
- Learn **C++ by doing** (not just theory).  
- Covers the **entire spectrum**: basics → OOP → memory → templates → STL → advanced concurrency → design patterns → even OS-like subsystems.  
- Each step builds on the previous one, making your knowledge grow like Titan++ itself.  
- Serves as a **portfolio repo** — proof of your C++ skills for internships, jobs, or research.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
Titan++ is divided into **50 stages** (from easiest → hardest).  
Each stage lives as its own commit/project folder in this repo.

Examples of stages:
- **Step 1:** Hello World  
- **Step 5:** Custom Vector Class  
- **Step 12:** File Logger System  
- **Step 25:** Memory Pool Allocator  
- **Step 35:** Smart Thread Pool  
- **Step 50:** Tiny Shell (CLI interface)
